Although , ideally it shouldn’t mean anything(or mean something completely unrelated to the meaning that it was originally supposed to mean ), a general understanding is still possible because of our familiarity of "বাংলা" language. This familiarity is a boon and a bane. The fact that we are able to understand this phrase, even when we know that this is a wrong representation of the phrase “ খেলা হবে" , gives us an example of human cognitive adaptability. </span></p>↵<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 1.2rem;font-family: Segoe UI", "Source Sans Pro", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;">A form where words are written phonetically with English letters may be defined as “Romanized”. Example: The Bangla phrase “ খেলা হবে"  can be represented as “Khela Hobe”.</span></p>↵
